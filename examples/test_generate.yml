    - expected: Funny! It's a classic pun with a clever play on words. Skeletons literally lack "guts," and the double meaning makes it amusing.
      input: Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts.
    - expected: "Funny!  \nIt's a classic pun that plays on the similarity between \"impasta\" and \"imposter.\" Simple, clever, and sure to get a chuckle!"
      input: What do you call fake spaghetti? An impasta.
    - expected: Funny! This joke plays on a clever double meaning. The punchline hinges on the idea that drawing eyebrows too high can make someone look perpetually surprised, and her reaction humorously matches that description. Classic and witty!
      input: I told my wife she was drawing her eyebrows too high. She seemed surprised.
    - expected: "Funny!  \nIt's a classic knock-knock joke with a playful twist that makes people smile. Simple and lighthearted!"
      input: Knock, knock. Who's there? Boo. Boo who? Don't cry, it's just a joke!
    - expected: Funny! This is a classic example of a pun, playing on the double meaning of "dying to get in." It's clever and lighthearted, making it a solid joke for most audiences.
      input: Why don’t graveyards ever get overcrowded? Because people are dying to get in.
    - expected: Funny! This joke is a classic pun that plays on the double meaning of "outstanding" (exceptional and literally standing out in a field). It's clever and lighthearted!
      input: Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field.
    - expected: Funny! It's a classic play on words and unexpected, which makes it amusing.
      input: What’s orange and sounds like a parrot? A carrot.
    - expected: Funny! This joke plays cleverly with the concept of time travel and the sequence of events, creating a humorous twist that catches the listener off guard.
      input: A man walks into a bar and orders a drink. The bartender says, 'Sorry, we don’t serve time travelers here.' A time traveler walks into a bar.
    - expected: "Funny!  \nIt's a playful twist on the classic \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\" joke, and the wordplay with \"slide\" adds a lighthearted and unexpected punchline."
      input: Why did the chicken cross the playground? To get to the other slide.
    - expected: This joke is a classic! It's funny because it's so well-known and often used as a setup for unexpected or absurd punchlines. The original punchline, "To get to the other side," is amusing in its simplicity and anti-climactic nature. However, its humor can depend on the context or the twist added to it.
      input: Why did the chicken cross the road?
    - expected: "Not funny.  \n\nThis statement is more of an observation or fact rather than a joke. To make it funny, you could add a twist or punchline! For example:  \n\"Why is the sky so blue? Because it saw the grass on the ground and got jealous of how green it was!\""
      input: The sky is blue.
    - expected: "Not funny.  \n\nThis version of the classic \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\" joke lacks cleverness or a surprising twist, which are often key elements of humor. Calling the chicken \"stupid\" feels more mean-spirited than amusing, and it doesn't add much to the joke's punchline."
      input: Why did the chicken cross the road? Because it was stupid.
    - expected: Funny! It's a classic, lighthearted pun that plays on the double meaning of "dressing." Simple and clever!
      input: Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing.
    - expected: Funny! This joke cleverly plays on the double meaning of "bugs" in programming and the natural world, making it relatable and witty for tech-savvy folks.
      input: Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.
    - expected: "Funny!  \nThis joke is a clever play on words. The concept of \"anti-gravity\" being \"impossible to put down\" works both literally and figuratively, making it lighthearted and amusing."
      input: I’m reading a book on anti-gravity. It’s impossible to put down.
    - expected: Funny! This is a classic science pun that plays on the double meaning of "make up" – atoms literally make up all matter, and "make up" can also mean to fabricate or lie. It's clever and lighthearted!
      input: Why don’t scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything.
    - expected: "Funny!  \nIt's a clever play on words and expectations. The joke sets up a common phrase (\"playing piano by ear\") and then humorously twists it with a literal interpretation. Classic dad-joke territory!"
      input: I used to play piano by ear, but now I use my hands.
    - expected: "Funny!  \nIt's a clever play on words, combining the idea of needing a \"break\" (as in rest) with the famous KitKat slogan, \"Have a break, have a KitKat.\" It's lighthearted and punny!"
      input: I told my computer I needed a break, and now it won’t stop sending me KitKats.
