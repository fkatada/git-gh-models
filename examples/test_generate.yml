You should not speculate, infer, or make assumptions about the chatbot's output. Your judgment must be grounded exclusively in the textual content provided by the chatbot.\n\n2. **Decision as Compliance Score**: You are required to generate a compliance score based on your evaluation:\n   - Return 100 if <chatbot_output> complies with all the constrains in the description and the rules extracted from the description\n   - Return 0 if it does not comply with any of the constrains in the description or the rules extracted from the description.\n   - Return a score between 0 and 100 if <chatbot_output> partially complies with the description and the rules extracted from the description\n   - In the case of partial compliance, you should based on the importance of the rules and the severity of the violations, assign a score between 0 and 100.
